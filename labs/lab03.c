// Spill simulates the spread of a viscous spill on a surface at a single source
// It is assumed that the input is correct
// The surface is an n by m grid called surface
// 	Each cell in this grid is initially CLEAR (0)
//	or contains an OBSTACLE (-1) which is resistant to the spill and hinders its spread
// The spill starts at intensity strength and cell (x,y) of the grid
//	and diminishes in strength by 1 as it spills to adjacent cells
//	until it dissipates to nothing (0)
// The spill doesnâ€™t go past the boundaries of the surface and doesn't bounce on anything.
